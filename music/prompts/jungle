An immersive liquid jungle IDM piece, sculpted in 432 Hz, opens with binaural dithering and spatialized organic glitch textures. Glistening percussion layers pulse beneath dense, plant-like synth pads, hinting bio-luminescence. Unpredictable stereo stabs and tense, evolving polyrhythms build ambush tension amid swirling low-end and filtered environmental ambiances for an infiltrative, exploratory planetary zone BGM.
